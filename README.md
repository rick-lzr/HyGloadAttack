# HyGloadAttack
HyGloadAttack code implementation

## Implementation Instruction
- Fork the repository https://github.com/RishabhMaheshwary/hard-label-attack and follow its instruction to install the environment
- First, run the code from **hard-label-attack**. Then simply run the run.sh script
- Note: The paths for some dependency files are hardcoded in the code and need to be manually changed.

## Attack Adversarial Training Model
We use code from the "dne" repository https://github.com/dugu9sword/dne to implement adversarial training.

## Acknowledgement
We thank the authors of https://github.com/RishabhMaheshwary/hard-label-attack for sharing their code.
